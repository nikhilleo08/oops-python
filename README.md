# 10-Day Plan: Object-Oriented Modeling and Design (OOMD) with OOP Basics, SOLID Principles, and Design Patterns

## **Day 1: Introduction to OOP Basics**
**Topics:**
- Object-Oriented Programming overview
- Key OOP concepts: Class, Object, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
- Introduction to OOMD: What is modeling and its importance?

**Activities:**
- Create a UML class diagram for a `Car` class.
- Write code implementing the `Car` class and its attributes/methods.

---

## **Day 2: Classes, Objects, and UML Basics**
**Topics:**
- Defining classes and objects in detail
- Understanding UML: Class diagrams, attributes, methods, and relationships
- Instance vs. class variables and methods

**Activities:**
- Design a `BankAccount` class in UML.
- Implement the `BankAccount` class with methods like `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `display_balance`.

---

## **Day 3: Inheritance, Polymorphism, and UML Associations**
**Topics:**
- Single and multilevel inheritance
- Method overriding and polymorphism
- UML: Associations, generalizations, and aggregations

**Activities:**
- Draw a UML diagram for an `Animal` hierarchy (`Animal -> Dog/Cat`).
- Implement the classes in code with polymorphic behavior.

---

## **Day 4: Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Use Case Diagrams**
**Topics:**
- Importance of data hiding (private/protected/public)
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- UML: Use case diagrams and actors

**Activities:**
- Design a UML use case diagram for an ATM system.
- Implement an abstract class `Shape` with concrete subclasses like `Circle` and `Rectangle`.

---

## **Day 5: Introduction to SOLID Principles and Sequence Diagrams**
**Topics:**
- Overview of SOLID principles
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- UML: Sequence diagrams

**Activities:**
- Refactor a program to adhere to SRP.
- Create a sequence diagram for a user logging into a system.
- Write a program to demonstrate OCP by extending functionality without modifying existing code.

---

## **Day 6: SOLID Principles Continued and Activity Diagrams**
**Topics:**
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- UML: Activity diagrams and workflows

**Activities:**
- Write examples to demonstrate LSP and ISP.
- Create an activity diagram for a shopping cart checkout process.
- Discuss and implement DIP using Dependency Injection.

---

## **Day 7: Introduction to Design Patterns and State Diagrams**
**Topics:**
- Overview of design patterns
- Categories: Creational, Structural, Behavioral
- Singleton pattern and Factory pattern
- UML: State diagrams

**Activities:**
- Implement a Singleton pattern (e.g., `Logger`).
- Design a state diagram for an elevator system.
- Write a Factory pattern program to create objects based on input.

---

## **Day 8: Structural Design Patterns and Component Diagrams**
**Topics:**
- Adapter, Decorator, and Composite patterns
- UML: Component diagrams and their significance

**Activities:**
- Implement an Adapter pattern to integrate incompatible interfaces.
- Design a component diagram for a library management system.
- Create a program demonstrating the Decorator pattern for adding dynamic behavior.

---

## **Day 9: Behavioral Design Patterns and Collaboration Diagrams**
**Topics:**
- Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns
- UML: Collaboration diagrams

**Activities:**
- Write a program for the Observer pattern (e.g., a news subscriber system).
- Design a collaboration diagram for a user placing an online order.
- Implement a Strategy pattern for a payment system with multiple payment methods.

---

## **Day 10: Revision, Project, and OOMD Consolidation**
**Topics:**
- Recap OOP concepts, SOLID principles, design patterns, and UML diagrams.
- Integrate OOMD concepts into a comprehensive problem-solving scenario.

**Activities:**
- **Final Project**: Design and implement an online shopping system using OOP, adhering to SOLID principles and incorporating design patterns.
- Create UML diagrams: Use case, class, sequence, activity, and component diagrams.
- Conduct a Q&A session and review the project deliverables.
